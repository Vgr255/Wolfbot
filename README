Use Python 3.2 (3.1 doesn't work)
configure botconfig.py.example (rename to botconfig.py first)
if desired, configure settings/wolfgame.py to modify game settings
run wolfbot.py

If looking to use the auto-update feature, you need the git shell
download the Git shell at http://git-scm.com/download/win for Windows
on Unix systems, `apt-get install git` then `git clone http://github.com/<user>/<project>.git`
you don't need to do `git pull` as the bot will do that as long as git is installed
you can clone the repository, or fork it. the IRC service needs to be enabled
Whenever the GitHub commit bot joins and says there's an update, it downloads it
ALLOW_GIT must be set to True in .\settings\wolfgame.py
